## Basic Model

The most simple model would be appropriate to start with.

**Possible Targets**
* Total Number of Cases
    * As used by [mobs lab](http://www.mobs-lab.org/ebola.html)

* Which characteristics of tweets predict an accelerated output?
   * EbolaTracking.org uses mentions on a map.

** Factors / Available Data **




** Training and Test Set **






**Scoring Metrics**
We'll have to choose which of the following scoring metrics to use:

* AUC (Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) [binary-classification]
* Gini (Gini Index) [binary-classification]
* LogLoss (Log Loss) [binary-classification]
* MCAUC (Mean Columnwise Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) [binary-classification]
* MeanUtility (MeanUtility) [binary-classification]
* CategorizationAccuracy (Categorization Accuracy) [multiclass-classification]
* MulticlassLoss (Multiclass Loss) [multiclass-classification]
* CorrelationCoefficient (CorrelationCoefficient) [regression]
* MAE (Mean Absolute Error) [regression]
* MCRMSE (Mean Columnwise Root Mean Squared Error) [regression]
* NormalizedGini (Normalized Gini Index) [regression]
* NWMAE (Normalized Weighted Mean Absolute Error) [regression]
* RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) [regression]
* RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error) [regression]
* SpearmanR (SpearmanR) [regression]
* MAP@{K} () [other]
* GestureNormalizedLevenshteinMean (Gesture Normalized Levenshtein Mean) [other]
* IntegerLevenshteinMean (Integer Levenshtein Mean) [other]
* LevenshteinMean (Levenshtein Mean) [other]
* MCE (Mean Consequential Error) [other]
* MeanFScore (Mean F-Score) [other]

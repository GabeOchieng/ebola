A shared wiki to facilitate machine learning to help cure and contain the Ebola virus.

Created initially by a group of instructors from the [General Assembly](http://www.generalassemb.ly) interested in using data science to make an impact on global health. Additional goals include:

* A means for data scientists to work together to help stop the Ebola virus
* A teaching tool to illustrate to data science students the value their contributions can make to critical global issues

Collecting and discussion predictive models for Ebola.

## Shaman et al / Columbia University "SEIRX" Model

* Suitability for a Kaggle: **High**
* Contact: **[Jeffrey Sherman](http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/author/jls106/), Columbia University**
* Method: **SEIRX** (see below)

#### SEIRX

"Prior modeling studies of Ebola have used expanded versions of a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model, in which additional compartments are employed to describe the Ebola transmission cycle more completely11,12,13 . For this effort, we add a compartment, X, for the deceased population to allow assimilation of mortality and case fatality rate data in addition to incidence. "
